  <h4>Medium</h4>
    <p>Through the one school year I've spent at San Jose State University, I've used many different ways to create digital art. I've used Adobe After Effects, Adobe Lightroom, Adobe Photoshop, Audacity, and MeshMixer.</p>

  <h4>Meaning</h4>
    <p>Most of the pieces have obvious meanings. I try to make my art pieces have straightforward messages because the range of audience is wide, and I want everyone to understand what I'm trying to show the world.</p>
