There are posters and signs around the environment that show the movement while the lanterns in the sky are supposed to represent the birth of new life and change in people.

          <h4><i>Bountiful Beachside Bento Box</i>, Found Objects, September 2021</h4>
          <p>An accumulation of knowledge is what drove this piece to its creative success. A creative process doesn’t stop and only continues to mature the artist and materialize as pieces of art. To help amass more information about climate change, my piece follows my personal journey of discovery in climate-change-related dangers by exploration of a small box holding a pollution-filled feast.
          </p>
          <p>As I learned of the efforts to promote recycling, I learned of the dangers of common household items through the many different professors, classes, and videos I have encountered. I have come to show the increasing amount of danger that such pollution can cause, particularly to the bodies of water, thus materializing as a sushi bento box. Much of the land pollution transforms into sea pollution, directly affecting humans as a result. Even sunscreen, a staple in a trip to the beach, can harm marine life if not chosen properly. The bento showcases very common recyclable components while also housing the different pollution threats that take many years to biodegrade. A recent problem for the ocean has been the pollution of face masks. A simple walk around a city or a suburb shows these single-use discarded masks on grounds, which can flow into the ocean.
          </p>
          <p>By taking note of the different components of the bento box and researching its effects on the ocean, creating a chain of information for these problems is possible. Yet, there is still a long way to go before this bento box is fully eaten and discarded.

          <h4><i>Ever-melting Childhood</i>, Plaster and other mixed media, November 2021</h4>
          <p>“The Circle of Life” is a well-known phrase that became the base of this piece. The piece explores the childhood that many have experienced while alluding to the constant flow of life. Only at the age of 19, I feel like time has frozen for me. I am in between the childish nature while learning the responsibilities of an adult. Here, I present a platter of the times and the flow of life.
          </p>
          <p>Growing up, I had always dreamed about the freedom of adulthood and what seemed to be the infinite capacity of knowledge in the world I had yet to learn. Now, I dream of simpler times where I cried about Barbie dolls and Barnie.
          </p>
          <p>I worked as a K-12 tutor from middle school till high school, so I have always been exposed to the growth of children. Amidst my occupation, I grew together with others that were both my students and my mentors. I realized the never-ending circle of growth that is present in the world. I haven't touched Crayons or Rainbow Loom bands in years. Yet, the hidden memories of my childhood have melted away because of my boyfriend’s 10 year old sister. And these memories will melt again and I will rediscover this in another decade once me and my peers begin to create families of our own. And after two or three decades, I will resume my role in the cycle as an elder. Maybe it won’t take the form of Legos and Crayons. But, the circle of the bright and golden base that adults provide, who also continue to nurture and care for the vibrant and colorful youth, will never end.

          <h4><i>The Man Who Lives 500 Years</i>, Packaging Tape and Mixed Media, December 2021</h4>
          <p>The distance of destruction left by a single human can extend well beyond five times their lifespan. Blurring the border of nature and human creation, my “dead” plastic human focuses on the disregard for life.
          </p>
          <p>Although in the shape of a human's natural subject, it is filled with recyclable items like bottles, aluminum cans, plastic bags, shampoo and soap bottles, and masks. The empty spaces are filled with newspaper clippings and masks cascade down from the head to the feet. Defying the natural lifespan of a human, mine takes on average 500 years to fully biodegrade, if it is even possible.
          </p>
          <p>Used as both a reflection of myself and my peers, the piece has unintentionally recognized the COVID-19 pandemic as part of the piece. As a result of taking my own trash, my eyes have opened to the amount of waste produced, especially during a time of medical emergency.
          </p>
          <p>Although my human is made of plastic and trash, it is in the best interest of the world that it also returns to nature. As a symbol of the natural world, a red spider lily (lycoris radiata) has been stabbed into the heart of the plastic man. The red spider lily is native to China, Korea, and Nepal and holds a spot in many Asian cultures, usually as “the hell flower,” “the flower of death,” and many other synonyms for death and reincarnation. To be hopeful for change and the eradication of unnatural forces taking away life is an important part of being alive in these current times. The flower is a symbol of my wish for such change. However, it is also reflective of my surrender to the disingenuous lifestyle many have consumed as the flowers are artificially made by me.
