          <p>A cultural critique on the gun control laws of The United States of America.

          <h3><i>"Move!"</i>, Digital Video, Two Minutes</h3>
          <p>This piece explores things that people, including me, use to decrease their anxiety. It is a space for the audience to relax from their everyday troubles. The title of this piece is both a form of irony and what you should do next. The space should be a place for relaxation, but also a reminder to keep yourself busy and move on from the past or whatever is making you anxious.</p>
